# [Project 1: Detecting Fire from Images](https://github.com/kofichtner/Fire_Detection)
•	Developed a fire detection method to be used in a portable, low-cost device for enhancing wildland firefighter safety
•	Used pixel normalization, color ratio, and image subtraction to detect location of fire with 100% accuracy under ideal conditions and 75% accuracy under adverse conditions 
•	Implemented a convolutional neural network to classify images containing fire
# [Project 2: Recycling Sorting Research](https://github.com/kofichtner/Recycling_Sorting_ML)
•	Ongoing project for developing a robust recycling classification algorithm to be used for a recycling sorting robot
# [Project 3: Brigham and Women's Hospital Kiosk Application](https://github.com/kofichtner/Recycling_Sorting_ML)
•	Collaborated with an Agile team of 10 students to develop a hospital kiosk desktop application
•	Designed and implemented software for map editing and navigation features
•	Presented application to Brigham and Women’s Hospital representatives
# [Project 4: Dynamic Sorting Robotic Arm](https://github.com/kofichtner/Dynamic_Sorting_Robotic_Arm)
•	Applied image segmentation techniques and color masking to locate, track and sort moving objects by color and size with a 3-DOF robotic arm
