      <description>Objective  Recycling and composting rates have been steadily increasing from 6.0% of total MSW in 1960 to 32.1% of MSW in 2018 [1]. With an increasingly large amount of waste being recycled, automating the process of sorting recycling would benefit the recycling industry by making facilities more efficient and improving conditions for workers who currently sort recycling by hand. Recycling workers are at risk for severe injuries including loss of limb if caught between moving machinery, being crushed by equipment, injuries from falls, and hand or finger amputation or laceration from sharp objects [2,3].</description>

      <description>Objective  In under one week, my team of 5 students developed a multiplayer cooperative game called &amp;ldquo;Initiative One&amp;rdquo;. The theme of the game jam was &amp;ldquo;Cooperition&amp;rdquo; meaning a combination of &amp;ldquo;competition&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;cooperation&amp;rdquo;. The game also needed to relate to STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math).
Summary  &amp;ldquo;Initiative One&amp;rdquo; emphasized &amp;ldquo;cooperation&amp;rdquo; by allowing up to 4 players to work together to research a planet. The researchers scan plants, animals, crystals, ore, and water to learn more about the planet.</description>

      <title>Fire Detection Research Internship</title>

      <description>Objective  Entrapment is a deadly safety concern for wildland firefighters. It occurs when firebrands ignite spotfires that quickly spread, blocking the firefighters escape routes and safety zones. The objective of this research is to develop a camera-based method for detecting spotfires that will be used in a low-cost, lightweight device worn by firefighters.
Summary   Developed a color ratio method for detecting fire to be used in a portable, low-cost device for enhancing wildland firefighter safety Used pixel normalization, color ratio, and image subtraction on RGB and Near-IR images to detect location of fire with 100% accuracy under ideal conditions and 75% accuracy under adverse conditions Applied color ratio method in pre-processing of images for convolutional neural network, improving test accuracy to 96.</description>

      <title>Brigham and Women&#39;s Hospital Kiosk Application</title>
      <link>https://kofichtner.github.io/Kaitlyn_Fichtner_Portfolio/post/hospital-kiosk/</link>

      <guid>https://kofichtner.github.io/Kaitlyn_Fichtner_Portfolio/post/hospital-kiosk/</guid>
      <description>Objective  My team of 10 studens developed a hospital kiosk application to help hospital visitors and patients navigate Brigham and Women’s Hospital. To help patients easily find where they need to go for appointments, our application has options for searching for locations using a doctor’s name. In addition to serving as a pathfinding application, the application allows users to request various services including internal transportation, security, sanitation, translator services, and more.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Sorting Robotic Arm</title>
      <link>https://kofichtner.github.io/Kaitlyn_Fichtner_Portfolio/post/sorting-robot/</link>

      <guid>https://kofichtner.github.io/Kaitlyn_Fichtner_Portfolio/post/sorting-robot/</guid>
      <description>Objective  Using a 3-dof robotic arm with a camera positioned above its task space, my team of 3 used computer vision to detect, locate, and sort objects by color and size.
Summary   Applied transformation matrices to convert pixel coordinates to positions in the task space Implemented image segmentation techniques and color masking to locate and sort objects by color and size Utilized inverse differential kinematic controls for smoother movements Continuously searched the task space so that the arm could dynamically follow moving objects Built a URDF simulation of the robot   View GitHub Repository View Video View Project Report</description>
